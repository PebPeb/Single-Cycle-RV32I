# RISC-V Single Cycle RV32I CPU

Welcome to the 

## Compiling Code

### Requirements

- A general understanding of the RV32I implementation as referenced in the [RISC-V Instruction Set Manual](https://riscv.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/riscv-spec-v2.2.pdf)
- GTKWave or a simulator of your choice (All my scripts are set up with GTKWave)
- 32 bit RISC-V Toolchain ([guide to build the toolchain](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-gnu-toolchain)) for more details on how to compile assembly refer to programs folder.



**Note:** This project is currently under active development and I'm not perfect ;)
